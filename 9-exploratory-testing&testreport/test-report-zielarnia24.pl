Summary of all defects

Defects found during exploratory testing: 

ID_1 - “Do koszyka” button is not visible for out of stock products” (page 2).
ID_2 - “Quantity functionality is not implemented in the product card” (page 3).

Summary of test completion criteria:
The assumed realizations have been made - during 60 minutes of testing completely checked all functionalities on home page and partly product card.
At this time were found two defects (details are included in exploratory testing report). Additionally was found another one, which is related to the lack of appearance of the Facebook window. 
During the performance of the approval scenario in the incognito mode this problem did not appear. 
The estimated time of 60 minutes allowed to completely test the functionality and usability of the home page, however the rest of the website requires thorough time (approx. 30-40 minutes more). During this time the purchasing process should be tested.
