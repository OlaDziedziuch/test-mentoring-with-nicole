3) The developer cannot reproduce the bug.

I show the developer how I cause the defect (in person or through a shared screen). 
During the meeting, we compare the environment and the versions in order to check if we reproduce the defect on the same way. 
If there is no possibility of direct contact, I suggest that I send an attachment with a recorded video playing.
